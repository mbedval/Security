### IOT Overview
#### WHAT is Intertnet Of Things (IoT)
- IoT can best be thought of as 
	- the process of connecting everyday objects an systems to network (internet)
	- Make all devices globally available and interactive
- Include devices from all sectos
- There are currently over 12 billion IoT devices connected to the Internet. In 2025 that number is expected to reach nearly 40 billion

#### SCENARIO 
You are attending a cybersecurity conference and just watched a security researcher demonstrating the exploitation of web interface on a SCADA / ICS component
This caused the device to malfunction and be destroyed
You recognized that the same component is used through your company's manufacturing plants
What can be done to protect against this emergent threat?
Evaluate if the web interface must remain open for the system to function . If it isn't needed, block the web interface.

##### SCENARIO EXPLAINATION
The most immediate protection against this emergent threat would be to block the web interface from being accessible over the network
Before doing this, you must evaluate whether the interface needs to remain open for the system to function properly 
If it is not needed , you should block it to minimize the SCADA / ICS component's attack surface
Ideally, your SCADA /ICS component should already be logically or physically isolated from the enterprise network

### 18.5 IoT Hacking Countermeasures
#### DEFENDING AGAINST IoT HACKING
- Today there are no longer clearly defined network perimeters
- Attacks are just as likely to pivot off a trusted internal user (phishing - drive-by malware) than through external alone
- Defense in depth is not enough for IoT
- You must create a fabric of defense based on Zero-Trust and automation
	- Every connection and endpoint is considered a threat
	- Analyze activities in real-time
	- Automatically lock threat as they materialize
- Approach security as a unified , integrated, holistic system
- Create an asset inventory and map out all possible ingress and egress paths
- Determine if the IoT networks has its own (inappropriate / rogue ) internet gateway 
- Disable Guest and demo accounts if enabled
- Implement any existing lockout feature
- Implement the strongest available authentication mechanism. Prefer two way authentication with SHA and HMAC hashing
- Locate control system network and devices behind firewalls
- Isolates them from the business network
- Implement IDS / IPS on the network
- Implement end-to-end encryption using 
- USe VPNs when possible
- Only Allow trusted IP Address to access the device from the Internet
- Disable UPnP ports on routers
- Protect devices from physical tampering
- Patch vulnerabilities and update firmware if available
- Implement secure boot with cryptographic code signing when possible
- Monitor traffic on port 48101 as infected devices tend to use this port
- Ensure that a vehicle has only one identity
- Implement data privacy and protection as much as possible
- Implement data authentication, authenticity and encryption whenever possible.
- Use a CAPTCHA with account lockout to avoid brute forcing
- Use a trusted execution environment (TEE ) to secure sensitive information
- Validate code immediately before its use to reduce the risk of time-of-check to time-of-use (TOC-TOU) attacks
- Secure encryption keys in a secure Access Module (SAM) Trusted Platform Module (TPM) or hardware security Module (HSM)
- Disable WEbRTC in the browser to prevent disclosure of IP addresses
- USe ad blockers and non-trackable browser extensions to prevent web-based attacks on IoT devices.
- Consider using a SaaS platform Azure IoT Central to simplify IoT setup.

- Industrial Network
	- A network of automated control systems
- Business Network
	- AKA Enterprise network
	- A "normal" IT network of system that provide information infrastructure for the business.
- Industrial Protocols
	- Protocols such as s7 (Proprietary) , CDA , SRTP and non-proprietary) Modbus , OPC, DNP3, CIP
	- Used to serial communication or over standard Ethernet
- Network Perimeter
	- Outermost boundary of a network zone.
- Electronic Security Perimeter
	- Boundary between secure and insecure zones
- Critical Infrastructure
	- A collection of physical or logical systems and assets
	- If it fails or is destroyed it would severely impact security, the economy or public health

#### COMPONENT OF OT
- SCADA : Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (is the central code)
- Communicated via #DCS Distributed Control System #RTU Remote Terminal Unit #PLC Programmable Logic Controller
- #ICS Industrial Control Systems
- #IIoT Industrial IoT
- OT
#### IIoT
- A subset of the Larger IoT
- The use of IoT in industrial sectors and applications. Including rebotics, medical devices, and software-defined production processes
- Collect and share data between devices to make decisions without human interaction
- Strong focus on:
	- Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication
	- Big Data
	- Machine Learning
- Leverage cloud based serverless architecture for large scale analytics . Data from individual SCADA systems feed #IIoT
- #IIoT enables industries and enterprises to have better efficiency and reliability in their operations

#### EVOLUTION OF INDUSTRY TO IoT
industry 1.0 : manual production
industry 2.0 : Industry + electricity = MAss Production
industry 3.0 : Mass production + computerised manufactoring = #SCADA supervisor control and DAta acquisition : 
industry 4.0 : SCADA+ internet = IIoT

### 18.7 IT-OT CONVERGENCE
#### IoT Convergence
These two work together
- OT : Manufacturing Zone:
	- Mechanical Devices

	- Networks
	- Storage and Data Processing
	- SQL, JAVA , Python, etc.

##### ENTERPRISE ZONE

	- Technologies and Protocols: DCOM, DDE, FTP/ SFTP , GC-SRTP, IPv4, IPv6, OPC , TCP/IP, Wi-Fi
- Level-5 Enterprise Network
	- Business-to-Business (B2B)
	- Business-to-Customer (B2C)
	- Accumulates data from subsystems at individual plats
	- Aggregates inventory and overall production status
- Level 4 - Business Logistics Systems

#### PROTECTING OT FROM IT
- Enterprise and manufacturing zones are often connected via ethernet
- A standalone , unconnected ("islanded") OT system is inherently safer from outside threats that one connected to an etnerprise IT system(s). Nearly all enterprise network have external connectivity
- An intermittently connected OT System can be a good compromise.
	- It is only at risk when it is connected
	- Connections should be on a need-basis such as for downloading updates or limited-time remote access
- The most common external connectivity into the OT environment is 3rd party connections from vendors. Their risk becomes your risk

### 18.9 OT Vulnerabilities
#### OT 's' Biggest Security challenge
- ICS and SCADA system are difficult to retrofit with modern security
- Most were developed many years before security standards were established and integrated into their design
- Many of these older systems data back to the in 1970s and are still in use today
- Over time, these systems were incorporated into the organization TCP/ IP data networks : This provides a huge exploitation area by penetration tester and attackers alike
- Many ICS and SCADA vendors are slow to implement security measures
- Because they cannot be easily retrofitted with the newer security requirements
- For ecample, some ICS/SCADA systems use a proprietary operating ssytem
- More Modern ICS /SCADA operates using a version of Windows
- However, many still use Windows XP , making them much more vulnerable since they cannot be upgraded to windows 10 without hardware replacement
- ICS and SCADA systems should ALWAYS be isolated from production networks and segmented into their own logical network (VLANs)

#### OT CHALLENGES\
- LAck of Visibility
- Plaintext / weak passwords
- Network complexity
- Legacy technology
- Lack of antivirus protection
- Lack of skilled security professionals
- Rapid pace of change
- Outdated Systems
- Haphazard modernization
- Insecure connections
- Usage of rogue devices
- Convergence with IT
- Organization challenges
- Unique production networks / proprietary software
- Vulnerable communication protocols
- Remote Management Protocols
