# Introduction to ethical Hacking

Information warfare (info-war) weapons inlcudes Virus, worms, trojans horses, Logic Bombs, Trap doors, nanomachines, and microbes, electronics jamming and penetration exploits and tools.
## Understanding information security controls like
- Information Assurance
- Defence-in-depth
- Risk Management
- Cyber threat intelligence
- threat modeling
- Incident management Process
- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning- 


## Type of Attack
### Passive Attack
- Footprinting
- Sniffing and eavesdropping
- network traffic analysis
- Decryption of weakly encrypted traffic
### Active Attack
- Denial of Service Attack (DoS)
- Bypass protection mechanism
- Malware attack 
- Modification of information
- Spoofing attacks
- Replay attacks
- Password-based attacks
- Session Hijacking
- Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) 
- DNS and ARP Poisonings
- Compromised-key attack
- Firewall and IDS attack
- Profiling
- Arbitrary code execution
- Privilege's escalation
- Backdoor access
- Cryptography attack
- SQL injection
- XSS attacks
- Direction Traversal attack
- Exploitation of application and OS Software

### Close-In attacks
- Social Engineering ( using #eavesdroppin, #sholdersurfing, #dumpterDiving #Tailgating #Third-Party-Authorization)
### Insider attack
- Eavesdropping and wiretapping
- Theft of physical devices
- Social engineering
- Planting keyloggers, backdoor or malware
- Data Theft and spoliation
- Pod Slurping
-
### Distribution attack
- Modification of Software or hardware during production
- Modification of software or hardware during distribution


## Hacking Methodology and Framework
- Certified Ethical Hackers (CeH) Methodology
- Cyber Kill Methodology
- MITRE attack framework
- Diamond Model of intrusion Analysis





- Risk Management is a continuous process performed by achieving goals at every phase, It helps reduce and maintain risk at an acceptable level by utilizing a well-defined and actively employed security program
- Cyber Threat Intelligence is the defined as the collection and analysis of information about the threats and adversaries and the drawing of patterns that provide the ability to make knowledgeable decisions. preparedness, prevention and response actions against various cyber-attacks.
- This intelligence is collected from sources such as #OSINT, CTI Vendors, and #ISAOs and #ISACs. 
- A Piece of malware used to perform an attack is tactical threat intelligence, whereas the details related to the specific implementation of the malware come under technical threat intelligence
