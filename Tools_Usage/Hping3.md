Command Line network scanning and packet crafting tool for the TCP/IP Protocol
It can be used for network security auditing, firewall testing, manual path MTU discovery, advanced traceroute, remote OS fingerprinting, remote uptime guessing, TCP/IP stacks auditing, etc.

It handles fragmentation as well as arbitrary packet body and size, and it can be used to transfer encapsulated files under the supported protocols.
It also support idle host scanning. 
IP Spoofing and network/host scanning can be used to perform an anonymous probe for services.
Hping3 also has a Traceroute mode, which enables attackers to send files between covert channels. 
It firewalk-like usage allows the discovery of open ports behind firewalls.
Allow to perform manual path MTU discovery and enables attackers to perform remote OS fingerprinting.


| hping3 -1 Target-IP                                  | This command will perform ICMP scanning and determines the ones that are up. this is standard method used by OS, Router, Switch and IP-based devices for echo request and echo response as a connectivity tester between different hosts.                                                                                    |

| hping3 -1 10.0.1.x --rand-dest -I eth0               | This command will perform ICMP ping scan on entire subnet. It will send ICMP echo request randomly to all hosts.  as on                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| hping3 -A  Target-IP -p 80                           | This scanning technique can be used to probe the existence of a firewall and its rule sets.  When there is attempt to establishment of connection with the ACK bit , sophisticated stateful firewall does not allow the establish a connection. But if host is alive on a network and port is open, it returns RST response. |
| hping3 -2 Target-IP -p 80                            | This command perform scanning in UDP mode. It sends UDP packets, and it returns ICMP port unreachable message if port closed else do not return any message if the port is open                                                                                                                                              |
| hping3 Target-IP -Q -p 139                           | This command collects all TCP Sequence numbers generated by the target host                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| hping3 -S Target-IP -p 80 --tcp-timestamp            | By adding --tcp-timestamp arguments, we enable the TCP timestamp option, because Many firewall drop those TCP packets that donot have timestamp.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| hping3 -8 50-60 -s Target-IP -v                      | -8 (--scan) enables scan mode to scan range of ports on the target host. additionally -S allows to perform SYN scan                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| hping3 -9 HTTP -i eth0                               | This command will make Hping to the listen mode. It starts listening on Port 0(of all the devices connected in the network to interface eth0) intercepts all the packets all the packets containing the HTTP signatures, and dumps from the signature end to the packet's end.                                               |
| hping3 -S 192.168.1.1 -a 192.168.1.254 -p 22 --flood | This command is used as flood technique why hping will use sooped if addresses to perform a DoS attack                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
