#### Network Time Protocol
- Network Time Protocol (NTP) is designed to synchronize the clock of networked computers
- It uses UDP port 123 as its primary means of communication
- NTP can maintain time to within 10 Milliseconds (1/100 second) over the public internet
- It can achieve accuracies of 200 microseconds or better in local area network under ideal conditions.

Attacker query NTP server to gather valuable information. such as 
- List of connected hosts
- Clients IP Address in a network their system names, and OSs.
- Internal IPs can be obtained if the NTP server is in the demilitarized zone (DMZ)

##### Tools

ntpupdate collects the number of time stamps from several time sources. I
```
